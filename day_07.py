# Operators in python
# There Are 7 operAtors in python which are mostly used
A = 67
B = 56
# Addition +
print(69 + 56)
print(A + B)
# SuBtraction -
print(69 - 90)
print(A - B)
# Multiplication *
print(89 * 56)
print(A * B)
# Exponential ** It work like A power 
print(5 ** 5)
print(A ** B)
# Division /
print(32 / 3)
print(A / B)
# Floor Division // It remove value after decimal
print(32 // 3)
print(A // B)
# Modulus % It is the remaining division like 3//2 => it show remainn '1' 
print(70 % 63)
print(70 % 65)
print(A % B)
# We can only use + operator to Add string not other can Be used
# Lets play with it
c = 't'
d = 'p'
print(c + d)


# Let's Create a CalculAtor

# so here we decleare 2 variable with value
